			<h2 class="about">DataTraffic map, or my first hackaton experience </h2>
			<br>
			<span>Sun, Aug 20, 2017</span>
			<br><br>
			<p>The main theme of hackaton was data science. All 10 teams were provided with data from hackaton data partners: velcom and priorbank. Velcom proposed to look at the correlation between customers leaving and other data and analyze how to make fewer people
				terminate their contracts. Initially, I was a member of velcom team, but it seemed to me that I didnâ€™t fit in. Therefore, I decided to switch to the Anatoli team, which wanted to create a map of real-time human population. Since similar data was being
				collected every day by mobile phone network providers across the world, our team assumed that velcom could provide us with information on the mobile network users movement in time. However they did not do it. Our project was about to already collapse,
				but Pavel CTO from amadoad provided us with the needed data and became a member of the team.

			<p>In the past few decades, geographical information and global positioning systems change methods of research and modeling distribution of human population in space and time. But standard methods like population census are more common (and expensive).
				Consequently spaced changes in scale of days or weeks are very hard to estimate, as well as the application of human population maps where timely information is required (such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics). Mobile phones have an extremely
				high penetration rate across the globe. We analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of mobile phone calls geolocated to the tower level which may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, and realized that the use of mobile phone data
				is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 358 thousand phones, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs
				produced using alternative human population mapping methods.

			<h2>Which problem it solves?</h2>
			<p><br> The aggregated data from cell phones is used to understand urban dynamics in real time. By revealing the pulse of the city, the project aims to show how technology can help individuals make more informed decisions about their environment. In the
				long run, will it be possible to reduce the inefficiencies of present day urban systems and open the way to a more sustainable urban future? <br>-With the help of our project, city architects can form a city in which it will be more convenient to
				live. For example, building or expanding roads where they are actually needed. <br>-Thanks to our visualization, companies can understand where it is better to promote their business, like locating a billboard where it suitable. Also, it is very cool
				for companies because they can know where their customers are currently located.
